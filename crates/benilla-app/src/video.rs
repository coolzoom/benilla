//! Deviation: `gxWindow "0"` is borderless fullscreen, not 1.12's exclusive mode-set at
//! `gxResolution`, because Wayland has no client mode-setting (winit ignores
//! `Fullscreen::Exclusive` there), X11's XRandR changes the desktop's mode and a crash leaves it

//! change that cannot resolve a monitor (`bevy_winit::winit_windows:91`, `system.rs:333`).

//! The `gx*` rows are latched until `RestartGx()`, as in 1.12; a restart re-asserts them against
